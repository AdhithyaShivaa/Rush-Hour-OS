"Rush Hour" is a fast-paced, turn-based word game designed for two players, where participants compete in a round-robin format. The game challenges players to form valid words based on randomly generated 1 or 2-letter prompts, earning points with each correct word while managing limited lives. Players must think quickly, as each turn is timed, creating a thrilling experience. Built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for the user interface and Pygame for background music, Bomb Party combines fun gameplay, a sleek dark mode interface, and an engaging soundtrack to create an interactive and competitive word game.
